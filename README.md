### Hi, I'm Mouad Malhoud👋

I am a young enthusiastic computer science student that likes to touch to everything. Since I was little, I have been charmed by the world of computing and the endless possibilities it offers. My quest for excellence and my education immersed me in a world where I was able to develop my skills in various programming languages, software architectures and development methodologies such as AGILE. I took this path because I want to help in my own way : create innovative and impactful solutions that will help the digital transformation that is shaping our society.🤝  

I like to try and explore new technologies. I don't really have a preference when it comes to frontend or backend... Maybe one day I'll make up my mind 😅. 

🎓 I will graduate mid 2024 with a computer science degree but will most likely stay on the school's path until I get my software engineer diploma.  
📚 [Currently] Collège Montmorency ➡ [2024-2025] Software engineering program.  
⚽️ Outside of the tech field, I do like to workout, especially calisthenics. I also enjoy watching football and esports.  
🎮 Video games took a big part of my life. They indirectly help choose this path of life.  
🌐 I like to follow the news and the cryptocurrency market.  
🔎 Currently willing to learn more about everything, still choosing a path :)
